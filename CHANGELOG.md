# Changelog

All notable changes to the TypeScript package will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Open-source contribution scaffolding via `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, GitHub issue forms, a pull request template, `CODEOWNERS`, and a CI workflow
- Maintainer documentation for repository protections, branch/tag handling, and release process management
- A tag-driven GitHub release workflow for `v*` tags that validates tag format, package-version alignment, changelog coverage, and local-equivalent verification steps before creating a GitHub release

### Changed

- Clarified npm installation, package-scope, and end-user setup guidance in the README
- Added Claude integration documentation explaining the difference between global skill installation, project-local integration, and graph generation
- Expanded README contribution guidance and linked maintainer-facing repository settings documentation

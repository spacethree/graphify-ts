## What ${SKILL_NAME} is for

${SKILL_NAME} is built around the /raw-folder workflow: drop anything into a folder—papers, tweets, screenshots, code, notes—and get a structured knowledge graph that shows you what you did not know was connected.

Three things it does that an assistant alone cannot:
1. **Persistent graph** — relationships are stored in ${CODE_SPAN_START}graphify-out/graph.json${CODE_SPAN_END} and survive across sessions.
2. **Honest audit trail** — every edge is tagged EXTRACTED, INFERRED, or AMBIGUOUS.
3. **Cross-document surprise** — community detection exposes connections across files that users often would not ask for directly.

Use it for:
- a codebase you are new to
- a reading list (papers + tweets + notes)
- a research corpus
- a personal /raw folder that keeps growing

## What You Must Do When Invoked

If no path was given, use ${CODE_SPAN_START}.${CODE_SPAN_END} (current directory). Do not ask the user for a path.

Follow these steps in order and do not skip steps.

function extractionRules(): string {
  return `### Step 3 - Extract entities and relationships

Before starting, note whether ${CODE_SPAN_START}--mode deep${CODE_SPAN_END} was given. Pass that state through every semantic worker.

This step has two parts: structural extraction (deterministic, free) and semantic extraction (LLM, costs tokens).

Run Part A (AST) and Part B (semantic) in parallel whenever possible.

#### Part A - Structural extraction for code files

Use the deterministic extractor for code files and write the result to ${CODE_SPAN_START}.graphify_ast.json${CODE_SPAN_END}.

#### Part B - Semantic extraction

Fast path: if the corpus is code-only, skip semantic extraction.

Before dispatching subagents:
- check the semantic cache
- split uncached files into chunks of roughly 20-25 files
- keep related files together when possible

Required extraction rules:
- EXTRACTED = explicit in source
- INFERRED = reasonable inference
- AMBIGUOUS = uncertain but still worth flagging
- include rationale nodes and ${CODE_SPAN_START}rationale_for${CODE_SPAN_END} edges when the corpus explains why a decision was made
- add ${CODE_SPAN_START}semantically_similar_to${CODE_SPAN_END} sparingly for genuinely cross-cutting similarities
- confidence_score is required on every edge
- EXTRACTED confidence_score = 1.0

Worker output schema:
${CODE_BLOCK_START}json
{"nodes":[{"id":"filestem_entityname","label":"Human Readable Name","file_type":"code|document|paper|image","source_file":"relative/path","source_location":null,"source_url":null,"captured_at":null,"author":null,"contributor":null}],"edges":[{"source":"node_id","target":"node_id","relation":"calls|implements|references|cites|conceptually_related_to|shares_data_with|semantically_similar_to|rationale_for","confidence":"EXTRACTED|INFERRED|AMBIGUOUS","confidence_score":1.0,"source_file":"relative/path","source_location":null,"weight":1.0}],"hyperedges":[{"id":"snake_case_id","label":"Human Readable Label","nodes":["node_id1","node_id2","node_id3"],"relation":"participate_in|implement|form","confidence":"EXTRACTED|INFERRED","confidence_score":0.75,"source_file":"relative/path"}],"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}

function buildAndExploreSection(kind: PlatformKind): string {

After merging AST + semantic extraction:
- build the graph
- cluster communities
- score cohesion
- generate GRAPH_REPORT.md and graph.json
- stop immediately if the graph is empty

### Step 5 - Label communities

Write concise 2-5 word labels for each community and regenerate the report with those labels.

### Step 6 - HTML, optional Obsidian, and optional extra exports

Generate HTML by default unless ${CODE_SPAN_START}--no-viz${CODE_SPAN_END} was given.
Generate Obsidian only when explicitly requested.

Optional exports:
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--directed${CODE_SPAN_END} → preserve edge direction in ${CODE_SPAN_START}graph.json${CODE_SPAN_END}, GraphML, queries, and shortest-path traversal while keeping community detection on an undirected connectivity view
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--neo4j${CODE_SPAN_END} → Cypher file
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--neo4j-push${CODE_SPAN_END} → direct push
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--svg${CODE_SPAN_END} → SVG
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--graphml${CODE_SPAN_END} → GraphML
- ${CODE_SPAN_START}--mcp${CODE_SPAN_END} → start the TypeScript stdio runtime with a minimal MCP-compatible prompt/resource/tool surface

### Step 7 - Benchmark and cleanup

If the corpus has more than 5,000 words, run the token reduction benchmark. Save the manifest, update the cost tracker, clean up temp files, then present only these report sections:
- God Nodes
- Surprising Connections
- Suggested Questions

Then immediately offer exploration by asking for the most interesting suggested question.
